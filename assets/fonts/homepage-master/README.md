# Custom Homepage
I was getting tired of staring at the Google webpage, so I went out in search of a new homepage. I came across [weboas.is](https://weboas.is/), a slick and functional alternative to the Google webpage. I went ahead an made some modifications of my own (such as removing the background and autoscaling the search help menu). The customized version can be found [here](https://ronitsinha.github.io/homepage/). Of course, it goes without saying that the original code is from [weboas.is](https://weboas.is/), a site which I recommend checking out (via the links in this README or the link on my site).
